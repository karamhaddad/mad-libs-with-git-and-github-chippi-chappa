Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Dio,

I am writing to you from a eccentric spaceship in a shameless galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a jacaranda rocket in February. There are 21 children and Teeth of Bee here! In the
Morgue there is a pool full of [11]. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
26 centuries. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
golfing on a stanky 2009 honda civic!!

Best wishes,
Chippi Chappa
